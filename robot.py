#(10 points): As a developer, I want a Robot to have a name, health, and active_weapon.
class Robot:

    def __init__ (self, name, robo_type_str):
        self.name = name
        self.dino_type = robo_type_str
        self.health = 100
        self.attack_list = []

    def droid (self):
        name = "Droid"
        attack_list = []

    def roomba (self):
        name = "Roomba"
        attack_list = []

    def bender (self):
        name = "Bender"
        attack_list = []
