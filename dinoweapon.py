#(10 points): As a developer, I want a Weapon to have a name and attack_power.

class DinoWeapon:

    def __init__ (self, str_name, int_attack_pwr):
        self.name = str_name
        self.attack_power = int_attack_pwr


    def raptor_claw(self):
        str_name = "Raptor Claw"
        attack_power = 30

    def bite (self):
        name = "Dino Bite"
        attack_power = 10

    def fire_ball (self):
        name = "Fire Ball"
        attack_power = 30

    def tail (self):
        name = "Tail Blast"
        attack_power = 20

    def trex_chomp (self):
        name = "T-Rex Chomp"
        attack_power = 50
